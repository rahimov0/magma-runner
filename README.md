# Abyss Diver

A retro pixel deep‑sea arcade game inspired by the classic Sony Ericsson / mophun era game **Deep Abyss** (2002).
Original art, code and level design. Rebuilt from scratch (formerly *Magma Runner*).

Pilot a little bathysphere through underwater caves, collect every gem to open the portal, find secret treasure,
manage your oxygen and survive 50 increasingly hard levels.

## Play
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run build      # production build -> dist/
npm run validate   # generates all 50 levels and proves each one is solvable
```
